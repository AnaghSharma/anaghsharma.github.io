                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">This project was done as part of a hypothetical project for Uber design assignment. The objective was to create an infographics from scratch demonstrating the pros of ride sharing in a city like New Delhi.</p>
                <h5 class="font-dark font-secondary-bold font-content mt5">Problem</h5>
                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">The problem statement aligns with the fact that a car remains unused for most of the time of the day and even when used only one person uses it.
                  <br><br>10 million cars in Delhi are used ineffectively.
                  <ol class="font-dark text-justify lh-copy mb4">
                    <li class="mv2">The car is unused for 23 hours each day.</li>
                    <li class="mv2">Average car occupancy is only 1.2 persons.</li>
                    <li class="mv2">70% of households in Delhi have 2 or more cars.</li>
                    <li class="mv2">If more people travel together, only 1/3rd of the current number of cars is needed.</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <h5 class="font-dark font-secondary-bold font-content mt5">Research</h5>
                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">I hadn't done any infographics project before this. To make sure that the infographics resonates with the brand Uber, I decided to go through each and every brand guideline that was publically available at <a class="font-primary-color">brand.uber.com</a>. I also explored their newsroom page and twitter profile to get the hint of artworks that they use.</p>
                <h5 class="font-dark font-secondary-bold font-content mt5">Visual Design</h5>
                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">I came up with this solution at third iteration. In the first two iterations, I was trying to focus more on the visualisation through cars. I wasn't going anywhere with that solution since those elements were distracting from the data.</p>
