                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">Personal identity revolves around building a unique identity around yourself. It is not limited to your social media profiles and certainly not to your logotype. Building a unique identity may provide a certain edge in the competition but altogether it depends on the philosophy you follow and the value it creates for the audience.<br><br> </p>

                <h5 class="font-dark font-secondary-bold font-content mt6">Story</h5>
                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">I started working on this project in July 2015 but this project never took off with great enthusiasm. We all procrastinate, don't we? And one of the reasons behind this is the fear of failure. We do not want to fail and that is why we are afraid of trying things. Even if we do start a project, we want it to be perfect. As perfect as Utopia. I was not going anywhere with the project because I wanted the identity to be perfect right from the beginning. I did many iterations but did not publish or produce anything deliverable because I was never satisfied with any iteration. <br><br>Coming back to the project, the personal identity and the concept behind it. I named this project as <strong>/Project Home/</strong>. A /home/ is the place where we live. A place where people can find us, meet us and know who we are. Similarly, personal identity is loosely based on the same fact. For a digital product designer, the centre for the personal identity is the website, acting as the /Home/ . </p>
                <h5 class="font-dark font-secondary-bold font-content mt6">Problem</h5>
                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">I started this project asking myself the obvious - Why? What are the problems that the project aims to solve? I listed down all the problems that I was having with the current system - <br><br>
                  <ol class="font-dark">
                    <li>Articulating who I am and what I do.
                      <ul class="mt2 mb3">
                        <li>If one needs to know about who I am and what I do, then the information on the web that I have put is fragmented. On LinkedIn (a professional network) it says - Digital Product Designer, on Twitter (a social media) it says - Designing, Making, Playing. I needed a unique identity to show what I do - design and build, what I have designed, how I design, and so on.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Conveying the message to right people.
                      <ul class="mt2 mb3">
                        <li>An identity is also helpful in maintaining professionalism and conveying the right message to right audience. For designers - they might know me as a designer who also builds stuff. For developers - they might know me as someone who does part-time coding. For recruiters - they might know me as a designer who understands technical constraints behind a project.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Showcasing my specialty - Design + Make
                      <ul class="mt2 mb3">
                        <li>There are many platforms out there to show the designersâ€™ work viz Behance, Dribbble. etc. They are essentially the same for everyone. I wanted to convey my philosophy of Designing and Building but found these platforms inadequate for the same.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Distinguishing myself from competition in digital presence.</li>
                  </ol>

                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">In order to progress with this project, some questions needed to be answered - <br><br>
                  <ol class="font-dark">
                    <li>Who is the owner of this project?</li>
                    <li>Who is my audience?</li>
                    <li>What value am I bringing to the different types of audience?</li>
