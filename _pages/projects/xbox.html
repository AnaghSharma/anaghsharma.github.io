                <p class="text-justify font-dark lh-copy mt4">The official XBOX app on iOS app has many flaws. I bought the XBOX ONE in October last year. Apart from exploring each and every option in XBOX, I also thought of giving the iOS app a try. I downloaded the app, signed in and landed on my feed. There were too many options on the screen. If you wanted to check your profile and achievements, good luck for that. Maybe the MS guys were feeling lazy since the IA, Layout and Visual Design appeared like a Windows 10 Mobile app. People on a particular platform such as iOS are familiar with apps having designs somewhat according to the preset guidelines. They see and use the familiar design everyday in the default apps and apps that they have downloaded from the app store.<br><br>Most of the apps use Tabs in the bottom for organising the content in iOS but the XBOX app is using the infamous hamburger menu. The moment you tap on the Hamburger Menu you find a plethora of superfluous options just to confuse you to some more extent. Psychologically our short term memory can help us to remember 4-5 items at a time. So if you are using an iOS app even for the first couple of times, chances are high that you will roughly know ‘Where to find What’. That’s why Tabs feel far more better in organising content instead of hiding everything aimlessly in the Hamburger menu. Plus tabs are easier to access being at the bottom of the screens.</p>
