    <p class="f2 lh-title font-medium">I am Anagh Sharma, a Designer and Creative born and currently based in New Delhi, India. I have been doing Digital Product Design from last couple of years with a strong focus on making. Since then I have successfully designed, built and published several products including mobile apps and websites.</p>
    </br>
    <p class="f4">My journey of getting into design has been no less than a bumpy ride. I enrolled myself in college to study Computer Science. At the same time, I started developing mobile apps. I took part in a contest organised by Microsoft India and ended up winning at 47th position in Top 50 Quality Apps category. These events eventually helped me to realise the significance of good design.</p>
    </br>
    <p class="f4">To design and build those apps, I started Galaxy Studio along with my brother to build apps for Windows Phone. Gradually, Galaxy Studio became one of the most successful publishers with approximately 4 Million total app downloads. These apps have an average rating of 4+ stars.</br>Later on, <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/the-power-of-side-projects/" class="font-primary-color font-medium">a stint at Snapdeal</a> helped me to move to design field.</p>
    </br>
    <p class="f4">My work has also received several noteworthy mentions on various internet media such as <a href="http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2014/10/this-weeks-best-android-iphone-ipad-and-windows-phone-apps-7/" class="font-primary-color font-medium">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2014/10/19/our-5-favourite-new-windows-phone-apps-of-the-week-29/" class="font-primary-color font-medium">Microsoft</a>, Nokia and others. The apps that I have designed & built have been featured in the Spotlight, Top Free, New + Rising apps sections of Windows Store for more than hundreds of times in more than 100 countries.</p>
