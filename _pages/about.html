    <p class="hero-text text-justify">I am <strong>Anagh Sharma</strong>, a Designer and Creative born and currently based in New Delhi, India. I have been doing Digital Product Design from last couple of years with a strong focus on making. Since then I have successfully <strong>designed, built and published</strong> several products including <strong>mobile apps and websites.</strong><br><br>I have always believed in the idea of making which powers me to bring my ideas to life. There have been many products in which I have worked from the nascent stage until the release day which resulted in kick-ass products. Those products have been loved by millions of people and have been featured by Microsoft, Nokia, Gizmodo and many more internet media.<br><br>I am always ready and eager to solve problems that I encounter everyday be it detecting the colour and hence the type of bus (AC/Non AC) in the dark or letting people know the probability of a crime at their locations at a given time. If you are trying to solve our day-to-day problems and want a helping hand, reach out to me at - </p>
