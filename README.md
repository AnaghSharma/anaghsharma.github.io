This is the git repo of my [personal website](https://www.anaghsharma.com) built proudly using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). While at it, also head to the [Dribbble project](https://dribbble.com/AnaghSharma/projects/442286-Personal-Website) for design updates.

## Why Jekyll and GitHub Pages
After using WordPress for about a year and half, I decided to switch to Jekyll and GitHub Pages for the ease of update and customisation. Domain and hosting are free with GitHub pages so you can basically set up a website without spending a dime. With Jekyll, I have more power on the visual design and reusability. For more details, go through this blogpost - [Switching to Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://www.anaghsharma.com/blog/switching-to-jekyll-and-github-pages/).

## Development
I have used [this repo](https://github.com/daigofuji/jekyll-foundation-6-starter) as a starting point. It enables you to use Jekyll in conjunction with the Foundation framework and hardly takes 5 minutes to set up.
